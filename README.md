# GlassJaw

GlassJaw is a vulnerable API environment for educational purposes. 

It's a fork of the ![vampi](https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI) project

### What is GlassJaw

GlassJaw is a vulnerable API made with Flask and it includes vulnerabilities from the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for APIs. It's a modification of the VAmPI project to add a little more challenging environment for finding vulnerabilities and to help developers in adversarial and defensive thinking when building code as well as tests. 


### Features
 - Based on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for APIs.
 - OpenAPI3 specs and Postman Collection included.
 - Global switch on/off to have a vulnerable environment or not.
 - JWT Token-Based Authentication (Adjust lifetime from within app.py)

|     GET    |        /books/v1/{book}       |      Retrieves book by title along with secret     |

For more details you can use a service like the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io) supplying it the OpenAPI specification which can be found in the directory `openapi_specs`.


#### List of Vulnerabilities
To be updated


 ## Run it
It is a Flask application so in order to run it you can install all requirements and then run the `app.py`.
To install all requirements simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and then `python3 app.py`.

Or if you prefer you can also run it through docker or docker compose.

 #### Run it through Docker

**Build with**
TBD

  #### Run it through Docker Compose
TBD


## Customizing token timeout and vulnerable environment or not
If you would like to alter the timeout of the token created after login or if you want to change the environment **not** to be vulnerable then you can use a few ways depending how you run the application.

 - If you run it like normal with `python3 app.py` then all you have to do is edit the `alive` and `vuln` variables defined in the `app.py` itself. The `alive` variable is measured in seconds, so if you put `100`, then the token expires after 100 seconds. The `vuln` variable is like boolean, if you set it to `1` then the application is vulnerable, and if you set it to `0` the application is not vulnerable.
 - If you run it through Docker, then you must either pass environment variables to the `docker run` command or edit the `Dockerfile` and rebuild. 
   - Docker run example: `docker run -d -e vulnerable=0 -e tokentimetolive=300 -p 5000:5000 vampire_docker:latest`
     - One nice feature to running it this way is you can startup a 2nd container with `vulnerable=1` on a different port and flip easily between the two.

   - In the Dockerfile you will find two environment variables being set, the `ENV vulnerable=1` and the `ENV tokentimetolive=60`. Feel free to change it before running the docker build command.
